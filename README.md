# Dataset_after_processing
1. process_data_34567_12_feature_engineering.pkl is a dataset after data preprocessing
2. train_x_12_feature_engineering.csv and train_y_12_feature_engineering.csv are the divided training set (The former is feature data and the latter is label).
3. valid_x_12_feature_engineering.csv and valid_y_12_feature_engineering.csv are the divided test set (The former is feature data and the latter is label).
